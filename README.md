### Hello! ðŸ›¸

I am a frontend/React developer in the Cincinnati area. The pinned projects below serve as my portfolio. Most of my work is on the frontend with React/TypeScript or vanilla JS, with some experience in Express backends.

I love to learn new things and challenge myself with new concepts and technologies in each project. Some of my portfolio repos contain notes on things I learned while working on the project.

In my spare time, I explore exciting and exotic languages like Rust, Haskell, and Racket, which have taught me a lot of concepts that transfer to JavaScript/TypeScript, like functional programming, OOP, generics, and closures.

Here are direct links to each of my projects:

Security note: I started GPG signing commits with vigilant mode on July 12, 2021. Any unverified commits from me dating after July 12, 2021, should be considered suspect.
