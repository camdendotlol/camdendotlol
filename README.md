### Hello! ðŸ›¸

I am a developer in the Cincinnati area. The projects below are mostly frontend, but my current job has me doing a wider range of stuff.

In my spare time, I explore different languages like Rust and Lisp. I look forward to getting more into these in the future and maybe contributing to some projects.

I recently finished creating an [educational website about the United Fruit Company](https://unitedfruitcompany.com) using Next.js and headless Wordpress.
