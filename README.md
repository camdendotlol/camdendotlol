### Hello! ðŸ›¸

I am JavaScript developer in the Cincinnati area. The pinned projects below serve as my portfolio. Most of my work is on the frontend with React/Vue, with some experience in Express backends.

In my spare time, I explore different languages like Rust and Lisp. I look forward to getting more into these in the future and maybe contributing to some projects.

I'm currently working on an [educational website about the United Fruit Company](https://github.com/BudgetMC/unitedfruitcompany) using Next.js and headless Wordpress.
