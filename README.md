### Hello! ðŸ›¸

I am a JavaScript/React developer in the Cincinnati area. The pinned projects below serve as my portfolio. Most of my work is on the frontend with React or vanilla JS, with some experience in Express backends.

I love to learn new things and challenge myself with new concepts and technologies in each project. Some of my portfolio repos contain post-mortem notes on things I learned while working on the project.

In my spare time, I explore exciting and exotic languages like Rust, Haskell, and Racket, which have taught me a lot of concepts that transfer to JavaScript/TypeScript, like functional programming, generics, and closures.

Here are direct links to each of my portfolio projects:

I am also working on a new personal website that will be deployed soon!
