### Hello! ðŸ›¸

I am a developer in the Cincinnati area. My current job has me doing mostly web stuff in the digital humanities. The projects below are older, but you might have some fun with them.

In my spare time, I explore different languages like Rust and Lisp. I look forward to getting more into these in the future and maybe contributing to some projects.

I recently finished creating an [educational website about the United Fruit Company](https://www.unitedfruitcompany.com) using Next.js and headless Wordpress.
