### Hello! ðŸ›¸

I am a full stack developer in the Cincinnati area. The pinned projects below serve as my portfolio. Most of my work is on the frontend with React/Vue, with some experience in Express backends.

In my spare time, I explore exciting and exotic languages like Rust, Haskell, and Common Lisp, which help illuminate the different ways we can talk to computers and provide alternate perspectives on problem-solving.

Here are direct links to each of my projects:

I'm currently working on an [educational website about the United Fruit Company](https://github.com/UFC-History-Project/unitedfruitcompany) using Next.js and headless Wordpress.

If you're interested in hiring me, you can contact me at (my first inital) at (my full name) dot com.
