### Hello! ðŸ›¸

I am a full stack developer in the Cincinnati area. The pinned projects below serve as my portfolio. Most of my work is on the frontend with React/Vue, with some experience in Express backends.

I love to learn new things and challenge myself with new concepts and technologies in each project. Some of my portfolio repos contain notes on things I learned while working on the project.

In my spare time, I explore exciting and exotic languages like Rust, Haskell, and Common Lisp, which have taught me a lot of concepts that transfer to JavaScript/TypeScript, like functional programming, OOP, generics, and closures.

Here are direct links to each of my projects:

I'm currently working on https://www.ostrakon.xyz/, but it's still in progress.

I'm also currently working on copy-editing the documentation for https://github.com/soapdog/patchfox (see https://github.com/soapdog/patchfox/commits?author=mythmakerseven)
